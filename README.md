# OpenCV Starter

This repository aims to familiarize with the OpenCV funcitonalities. Pre-requistes for this tutorial is Python and NumPy.

## Introduction

OpenCV is one of the most popular computer vision libraries. OpenCV today, supports a multitude of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning and is expanding day by day. Though OpencCV is available in wide range of programming languages i.e. C/C++, Python, OpenCV etc., but we will be focusing on Python. For the python stater tutorials please visit this [repository](https://github.com/visionatseecs/python-starter).

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.

Official Documentation of OpenCV is available [here](https://docs.opencv.org/).

## Installation

Before please proceeding please make sure you have installed on your system. If not you can look for installation details for python isntallation alongwith Anaconda [here](https://github.com/visionatseecs/python-starter/blob/main/01%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Installation/installation.ipynb)

To install opencv enter command:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

To confirm you installation, run following code in terminal or Python IDE:

```
import cv2 as cv
print(cv.__version__)
```

If the results are printed out without any errors, congratulations !!! You have installed OpenCV-Python successfully.
